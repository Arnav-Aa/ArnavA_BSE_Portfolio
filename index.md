# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was getting the arduino board and software set up, and then creating a smaller scale of the tic tac toe board. I had started with a 3x1 matrix at first, to serve as a prototype but also having room for expansion. Each light could be set to a binary set of blue and red colors. This would correspond to the "x" and "o" on a standard tic tac toe board. I had also added a restart button which would turn each LED off when pressed, as a way to start a new game.
