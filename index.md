# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was working on a winning formation and expanding the tic tac toe matrix. I added a new row of 3 more buttons and changed them from the previous ones for aesthetic purposes. This row of buttons would correspond to the next row of lights in the matrix.I had coded the arduino to identify the 8 win conditions of tic tac toe and having a win formation to go with it. The winning formation would consist of buzzer sound effects and lights. The lights would highlight the win condition by blinking for a couple seconds followed by sound effects played by the buzzer.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was getting the arduino board and software set up, and then creating a smaller scale of the tic tac toe board. I had started with a 3x1 matrix at first, to serve as a prototype but also having room for expansion. Each light could be set to a binary set of blue and red colors. This would correspond to the "x" and "o" on a standard tic tac toe board. I had also added a restart button which would turn each LED off when pressed, as a way to start a new game.
